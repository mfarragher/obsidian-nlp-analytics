# obsidian-nlp-analytics
This repo contains NLP analytics on some of my Obsidian.md vaults; I am experimenting with how algorithms can improve knowledge management workflows, via the functionality of Obsidiantools and NLP libraries.

The main focus of the NLP analytics is topic modelling.

## Proofs of concept
These are examples of functionality for which I am exploring proofs of concept:
- **Auto-generated Maps of Content (MOCs)** 
- _To be continued_

## Vaults
My vault content is private.  However the information in the notebooks and scripts that I have written could be re-applied to your own vaults with a little reworking.

These are vaults that I am using for prototyping:
- ðŸŽ“ **My MPhil degree notes**
    - For my master's degree I wrote all my notes in an Obsidian.md vault.
    - The vault has over 100k words of content spread across 500 MD files.
    - I studied 11 modules, so I assigned notes to folders for their respective modules.  I averaged about 50 notes per module.
    - The rigid structure of folders was convenient for revision.  I didn't develop any MOCs as the content was manageable for revision on a module-by-module basis.  However, one MOC per module would be great for future reference.  I am interested in auto-generating MOCs from the vault content and exploring which notes are the most important for each module.
- ðŸŽ¥ **Film noir vault**
    - I created a vault on 100+ film noir movies from IMDB data.
    - There are a few common themes in film noir so it would be interesting to see how films could be connected by their themes.  Examples of themes include murder, love, fear, corruption, etc.
    - I couldn't possibly develop a vault with notes on 1000s of films manually, so solutions that can create MOCs and/or wikilinks automatically would be great.  This could help me to discover new films to watch.
